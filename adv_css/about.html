            <h2 class="heading_style">The Origins of Minecraft</h2>
            <p>Minecraft started as a small independent project but quickly became one of the most well-known games in history. Inspired by games like Infiniminer and Dwarf Fortress, Notch aimed to create a world where players could build, explore, and interact freely. The game was first released in a pre-alpha state in 2009, allowing early players to test and shape its development. By the time Minecraft 1.0 launched in 2011, it had already built a massive fanbase. Microsoft saw its potential and acquired Mojang Studios for $2.5 billion in 2014, ensuring continued growth and innovation. Today, Minecraft is played by people of all ages and has influenced countless other games.

            <h3 class="heading_style">Core Gameplay: What Makes Minecraft Special?</h3>
            <p>
                🛠 Mining and Crafting
                At its core, Minecraft is about gathering resources and crafting useful tools, armor, and structures. Players start with nothing and must chop wood, mine stone, and craft tools to survive.
                </p>
                <p>
                🌍 Infinite Worlds to Explore
                Minecraft worlds are procedurally generated, meaning no two worlds are ever the same. Players can discover vast deserts, dense jungles, frozen tundras, and deep caves filled with hidden treasures.
                </p>
                <p>
                ⚔️ Survival and Adventure
                In Survival Mode, players must hunt for food, craft weapons, and battle monsters like zombies, skeletons, and creepers. For those looking for a challenge, Hardcore Mode adds permanent death—once you die, it's game over!
