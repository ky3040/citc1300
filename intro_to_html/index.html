    <h2>What?</h2>
    <p>Minecraft is a very popular video game in which creativity is the limit.
        It is famous for its stylized graphics and iconic gameplay, consisting of pixelated textures and voxels. As the name is written, you can mine and craft in Minecraft. There are two modes: Creative and Survival.
    </p>
    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p>There are many editions of Minecraft. Minecraft was initially written in Java, but has also been coded in C++. Currently there are two major editions:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Java: Minecraft coded in the programming langauge Java. Played primarily on computers.</li>
    <li>Bedrock (Newest): Minecraft coded in the programming langauge C++.
        Played on all platforms such as mobile devices, consoles, and computers. Also supports crossplay.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are some additional editions:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Legacy Console Editions (for example: Xbox 360 Edition): Existed before the creation of Bedrock and didn't have crossplay.</li>
    <li>Pi Edition: Free version of Minecraft that exclusively runs on Raspberry Pi</li>
    <li>Minecraft Education: Used for teaching school lessons in Minecraft</li>
    <li>China Version: Version specifically avaliable only in China</li>
    </ul>
